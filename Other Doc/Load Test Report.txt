        Explanation:
            I have create a load test that runs 294 request per minute and 5 request in a seconds concurrently, and the outputs indicates that it took a total of
            60.0046MS to accept and process the request.

            Grouping the request response time in Percentiles(%)
            50% of the request took 1026MS, 90% took 1098MS, 95% took 1158MS, 99% 1417MS.
